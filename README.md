<h1> Surprise Birthday Card - 04/12/2023 🧧 </h1>

<h2> ✨🎁🎂 This is a birthday card made by me for my birthday. 🎈🎉🎊 </h2>

<br> 

<p> A special person was born today. I am proud of myself and who I have become over the years. On this special occasion in my life, I pray for nothing else than the guidance of the Lord in everything I do and every path I take. A new cycle begins with new opportunities. </p>

<p> I started programming a few months ago and I know it's hard but I'll do my best to reach my goal. </P>
